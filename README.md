<h2><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong></h2>
This is a simulation of how a real social network feed works.
Strarting from an array of objects that contains all the post informations including the name, the profile picture of the person that made the post, the date it was posted, the image published and the copy that comes with the picture, the post cards are automatically generated.

The cards comes with some functionalities:
<ul>
<li> When you press like, the like button will change color, to make it clear it is already pressed. It will also be stored in an array.</li>
<li> If you press again the button style and the like saved in the array will be removed</li>
<li> If the user doesn't have a profile picture, will be generated a placeholder using their initials</li>
<li> Will be calculated how many month passed from the post publication</li>
</ul>
